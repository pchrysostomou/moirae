# moirae

You just watched five Raft nodes lose their network for two seconds. The two on the wrong side of
the wall tried twelve times to elect a leader and never could — every vote request died at the
wall. The three on the right side kept theirs. When the wall came down, one election settled it,
and a node that crashed came back with its log intact.

This is v0: three protocols (Raft, single-decree Paxos and the ABD atomic register), no trace
shrinking, no Byzantine faults, no membership changes, no pre-vote, nothing hosted. If you arrived
expecting Antithesis, this is the small, readable, TypeScript end of that idea — not a replacement
for it.

```
npx moirae demo
```

runs that scenario on your machine, prints what happened, writes `moirae-demo.jsonl`, and opens
it in the studio. One package, no dependencies, nothing to build.

```
npx moirae replay some-trace.jsonl
```

opens any trace the engine wrote. A trace replays byte for byte on any machine.
